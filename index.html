			<h3>Precautions for covid-19</h3>
			<p>
*Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
*Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br>
*Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.<br>
*Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>
*Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br>
*Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
*If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
				
			</p>

			<div class="course-col">
			<h3>What should be done if you have a COVID-19 patient?</h3>
			<p>Give suspect patient a triple layer surgical mask and direct patient to an earmarked and separate area, an isolation room if available. Keep at least 6 feet distance between suspected patients and other patients.
				
			</p>
			</div>
						<div class="course-col">
			<h3>What are signs and symptoms of the coronavirus disease?
			</h3>
			<p>Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.

Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent cleaning of hands using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; covering the nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing; and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough.
				
			</p>
			</div>
						<div class="course-col">
			<h3>How to eat healthy in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h3>
			<p>Consume enough fibre because it contributes to a healthy digestive system and offers a prolonged feeling of fullness, which helps prevent overeating.

To ensure an adequate fibre intake, aim to include vegetables, fruit, pulses and wholegrain foods in all meals. Whole grain foods include oats, brown pasta and rice, quinoa and whole-wheat bread and wraps, rather than refined grain foods such as white pasta and rice, and white bread.

Good hydration is crucial for optimal health. Whenever available and safe for consumption, tap water is the healthiest and cheapest drink. It is also the most sustainable, as it produces no waste, compared to bottled water.

				<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
<br>
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.<br> 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br><a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a>
