*Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>

			<h3>What should be done if you have a COVID-19 patient?</h3>
			<p>Give suspect patient a triple layer surgical mask and direct patient to an earmarked and separate area, an isolation room if available. Keep at least 6 feet distance between suspected patients and other patients.
				
			</p>
			</div>
						<div class="course-col">
			<h3>What are signs and symptoms of the coronavirus disease?
			</h3>
			<p>Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.

Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent cleaning of hands using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; covering the nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing; and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough.

						<div class="course-col">
			<h3>How to eat healthy in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h3>
			<p>Consume enough fibre because it contributes to a healthy digestive system and offers a prolonged feeling of fullness, which helps prevent overeating.

To ensure an adequate fibre intake, aim to include vegetables, fruit, pulses and wholegrain foods in all meals. Whole grain foods include oats, brown pasta and rice, quinoa and whole-wheat bread and wraps, rather than refined grain foods such as white pasta and rice, and white bread.

Good hydration is crucial for optimal health. Whenever available and safe for consumption, tap water is the healthiest and cheapest drink. It is also the most sustainable, as it produces no waste, compared to bottled water.
